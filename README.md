# Wrongful Conviction Data Processing Pipeline Stage 3

This repository represents the third and final stage of the IPNO's Wrongful Conviction Data Processing pipeline, focusing on network analysis. In this stage, we link entities from our wrongful conviction index with data from the Louisiana Law Enforcement Accountability Database (LLEAD) and IPNO's internal case management system.

## Overview

The Innocence Project New Orleans (IPNO) aims to reveal systemic issues within the criminal justice system by analyzing the misconduct histories of officers involved in wrongful convictions. This includes their partners, supervisors, supervisees, as well as the departments and units they are associated with. 

## Stage 3: Network Analysis

- **Purpose:** The goal of this stage is to conduct a comprehensive network analysis, linking individuals and entities across different datasets to reveal the broader systemic issues contributing to wrongful convictions.
- **Process:** We utilize the wrongful conviction index, the Louisiana Law Enforcement Accountability Database ([LLEAD](https://llead.co/)), and IPNO's internal case management system to construct a network.
